### Hi, I'm Andrea Karlova 
I am a research student at UCL. I am interested in designing molecular representations that can speed up development of new drugs and discovery of novel materials.
I hope that my work is a small step that can improve healthcare worldwide and help to mitigate the impact of the climate change.
