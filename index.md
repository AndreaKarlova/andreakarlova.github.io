### Hi, I'm Andrea Karlova
I am a research student at University Collage London. 
In my thesis, I focus on designing molecular representations 
that can speed up development of new drugs and discovery of novel materials.
I hope that my work is a small step that can improve healthcare worldwide and help to mitigate the impact of the climate change.
