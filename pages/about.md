I am a research student at UCL. I am interested in designing molecular representations that can speed up drug and novel materials discovery.
I hope that my work is a small step that can improve healthcare worldwide and tackle climate change. 
I decided to focus my attention on speeding up the discovery of the novel semi-conductors, which I believe can help achieve nearly zero-energy buildings, solar vehicles, portable electronic devices, to name amongst many.  In drug discovery, I have been lucky to work on projects with [April19](https://www.april19.ai/) related to the discovery of novel molecules penetrating the central nervous system. 
These are useful in enhancing the brain's neuroplasticity with applicability to mental health treatment. 

I have over 10 years of experience in tech, academia and the financial industry. I led the Data Science team in fintech startup Fractal Labs (Tomato Pay). Before switching to Tech, I spent 7 years by full-time research, including holding visitor research positions at Columbia University, Oxford-Man Institute and University College London working on quantitative finance research with Pat Hagan. Early in my career, I spent five years working for Belgium financial group KBC and as a consultant for PwC. 

I believe in peace, human rights, improving the lives of all beings and protecting our ecosystems.
