<h1 class="mx-auto" style="font-family:Courgette;">{{ page.title }}</h1>

I am a PhD student at University College London. 
I am interested in designing molecular representations that can speed up discovery of new drug designs 
and discovery of novel materials.
I hope that my work is a small step that can improve healthcare worldwide and tackle climate change. 

I have over 10 years of experience in tech, academia and the financial industry. I led the Data Science team in fintech startup Fractal Labs (Tomato Pay). I also built and led the Machine Learning team for high-speed train operator LNER. Before switching to Tech, I spent 7 years by full-time research, including holding visitor research positions at Columbia University, Oxford-Man Institute and University College London working on quantitative finance research with Pat Hagan. Early in my career, I spent five years working for Belgium financial group KBC and as a consultant for PwC. 

I believe in peace, respecting and protecting the human rights, improving the lives of all beings and protecting our ecosystems.
